Place your Cooperplate font files here (ensure you have the right license).

Recommended file names:
- Cooperplate.woff2
- Cooperplate.woff

Vite will copy and rewrite asset URLs during build so the CSS @font-face in `src/styles.css` will reference them correctly.

If you prefer to put fonts in `public/fonts/`, update the `@font-face` src URLs in `src/styles.css` accordingly.
